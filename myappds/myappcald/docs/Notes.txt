Notes

1.
Browsers act as clients.

2.
SignalR offers the possibility of grouping connections based on whatever criteria we deem relevant. 
To manage those groups, we use the groups property, available in the PersistentConnection class. 
The groups do not need to exist previously nor do they require any kind of additional managing. 
They are created when the first connection is added to them and are automatically eliminated when they become empty.

Due to the scalability of SignalR, we cannot obtain information about the groups.
If we want it, we must implement it, outside SignalR.

3.
We will be using the forms-based authentication.
We will use the database for the information to authenticate a user on a web application.

4.
We will store information about groups in a database.

5.
We will store information about users in a database.

6.
The project uses the following programming languages and frameworks.
a) HTML
b) JavaScript
c) SQL
d) .Net
e) JQuery
f) Ajax
g) Json
